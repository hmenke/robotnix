# Installing for the first time and verified boot

It is assumed that you have successfully built your image and signed it with
your own keys.  Make sure that you know the location of the image and the AVB
signing key.  The instructions in this document were tested on the Google Pixel
4a (sunfish).  For other devices please refer to
https://source.android.com/setup/build/running

 0. Before you can begin you have to boot the stock OS and go to “Settings /
    System / Advanced / Developer options” and enable “OEM unlocking”.  On my
    device I had to insert a SIM card and connect to the network for that, so
    it looks like you have to connect your device with Google at least once.
    This is part of Google's so called Factory Reset Protection (FRP) for
    anti-theft protection
    (https://grapheneos.org/install#enabling-oem-unlocking).  However, [this
    comment](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/grapheneos-das-android-fuer-sicherheits-und-datenschutzfreaks/#comment-52681)
    on a German IT privacy blog suggests that it is sufficient to allow access
    to the captive portal such that the phone thinks it is online.

 1. First reboot into the bootloader. You can either do that physically by
    turning off your phone and then holding both the POWER and the VOLUME DOWN
    button to turn it back on, or your can connect the phone to your computer
    with USB Debugging turned on and issue
    ```console
    $ adb reboot bootloader
    ```

 2. Connect your phone to your computer and run
    ```console
    $ fastboot devices
    09071JEC217048  device
    ```

 3. First flash your custom AVB signing key using
    ```console
    $ fastboot erase avb_custom_key
    $ fastboot flash avb_custom_key avb_pkmd.bin
    $ fastboot reboot bootloader
    ```

 4. To flash you image use
    ```console
    $ fastboot -w --skip-reboot update sunfish-img-2020.11.06.04.zip
    $ fastboot reboot bootloader
    ```
    This will erase the `userdata` partition (`-w`) and prevent the automatic
    reboot after flashing (`--skip-reboot`). Instead it reboots back into the
    bootloader from where the user can then manually trigger the reboot using
    ```console
    $ fastboot reboot
    ```

 5. At this point you want to relock the bootloader to enable the verified boot
    chain.
    ```
    $ fastboot flashing lock
    ```
    This step has to be confirmed on the device.

 6. After rebooting you will be greeted with an orange exclamation mark and a
    message like

    > Your device is loading a different operating system.
    >
    > Visit this link on another device:
    > g.co/ABH
    >
    > ID: BA135E0F

    This is expected because Android Verified Boot is designed to warn the user
    when not booting the stock OS, see
    https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/boot-flow.  In fact, the
    ID on the last line are the first eight characters of the fingerprint of
    your AVB key.
